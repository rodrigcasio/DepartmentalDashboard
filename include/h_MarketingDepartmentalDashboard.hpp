/*
// first approach for method getMemberCount():
   int getMemberCount() const{
                if(!teamMembers.empty()){
                    return teamMembers.size();
                }
                return false;
            } 

    but ended up using return static_cast<int>(teamMembers.size()); 
    which converts teh value returned by teamMembers (which is a type of size_t, an unsigned integer type)
    into an int. Basically we're tellig the compilers: 'Take the size of the vector (which is a size_t)
    and convert it to an int for my return value.
